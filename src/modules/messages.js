of each move. M4R1A can decide which moves to show on the board using this \
statistic. Often the U statistic remains high for most moves, when Leela \
thinks the right move is "obvious".`;


exports.about_versus_mode =
`The "play this colour" option causes Leela to evaluate one side of the \
position only. The top move is automatically played on the board upon \
reaching the node limit (see the Engine menu). This allows you to play \
against Leela.

The "self-play" option causes Leela to play itself.

Higher temperature makes the moves less predictable, but at some cost to \
move correctness. Meanwhile, TempDecayMoves specifies how many moves the \
temperature effect lasts for. These settings have no effect on analysis, \
only actual move generation.`;

M4R1A does not append to PGN files, nor does it save collections. It \
only writes the current game to file. When you try to save, you will be \
prompted with a standard "Save As" dialog. If you save to a file that \
already exists, that file will be DESTROYED and REPLACED with a file \

You can enable save in the dev menu.`;
